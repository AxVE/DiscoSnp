1.3.2: (09/09:2013)
 * parallel version by default
1.3.1: (04/06/2013)
 * version special for liviu - paralelle version. COMMENT line 632 of outputs.c ("#define LIVIUS_TESTS") to come back to version 1.3.0 (and also modify the version number text in kissReads.c) 
1.3.0: (29/04/2013)
 * Adding the -I option for dealing with inversion outputs
1.2.7 : (12/04/2013)
 * fixes a bug when the rank is bigger than 1 (due to values bigger than INT_MAX
1.2.6 : (09/04/2013: hotel Kyriad, Poitier)
 * avoid a pass counting the number of reads
 * replaces the hash tables for a simple boolean vector to know if a fragment was alread mapped by a current tested read (note that this does not test if a read maps at distinct places of the fragment)
1.2.5 : (05/04/2013: bon anniversaire mil) 
 * read coherence does not take anymore care about the last k-1 positions
1.2.4 : (17/02/2013)
 * some substitutions (expect on the central position containing the SNP if applied on a kissnp output) may be authorized while mapping a read to a fragment
 * added option -n (replacing compilation with CFLAGS=-DGET_ONLY_UPPER_CHARS)
 * removing useless option -q
 * fixed a bug: the central position never supported any substitution, while this behaviour is limited while analysing the kissnp output only. Now without the option -n, the central position is treated as the others
 * added option -i (index seeds each index_strike position)
1.2.3 :
 * Major memory revision: (memory was the main bottleneck)
	- change the datastructure for storing less information per seed (lossless but a bit longer)
	- index only one seed each "index_strike" position on the starters (in fragment_index.c). (lossy)
 * default (else change in the makefile removing the "-DGET_ONLY_UPPER_CHARS" occurrences): this is adapted to the kissnp output where the SNP (2k+1) is in upper case and the two extensions are in lower case. Quality and coverage are computed only on the 2k+1 part, the rest being identical between the upper and the lower path of each event.
